This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: unhandled promise rejections in asynchronous middleware. The `bug.js` file shows an example of an Express.js route handler that performs an asynchronous operation without proper error handling.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that includes comprehensive error handling.

## Problem

Asynchronous operations within Express.js middleware often involve promises.  If these promises reject (due to errors like database connection failures, network issues, or API errors), and the rejection is not caught, it can lead to silent failures that are difficult to debug.  The application might appear to work correctly, but unexpected behavior or data corruption may occur.

## Solution

The solution involves wrapping asynchronous operations in try...catch blocks or using `.catch()` on promises to handle potential errors gracefully.  Appropriate logging or error reporting mechanisms should also be implemented to alert developers about any issues.
